# foodbear

This a food ordering site project made with React, first bootstrapped with [CRA](https://create-react-app.dev/), now migrated to [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

Currently, the food items are static and embedded into the application. Also, there is no state persistance between refreshes. In the future, backend API and authentication will be added to make the site more dynamic.
